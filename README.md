# Safe Pass
DeFi white-list and black-list

This whitelist and blacklist are used to protect users from phishing, fake airdrops, and fraudulent websites.

Any individual or team can submit a PR and work together to maintain this list.

We encourage wallet providers to prominently mark whether a current DeFi site is malicious or not.
